			<h1>WHAT IS ROTTERDAM CREATIVE CODING MEETUP?</h1>
			<div class = "text">
			ROTTERDAM CREATIVE CODING MEETUP is a group for anyone interested programming, patching or soldering. We focus on all creative applications of technology. We organize informal events where you can meet and share your interests.
				The group is open to anyone no matter your experience. It doesn't matter whether you are a professional or a tinkerer in your garage/bedroom. Even if you have no experience but are simply interested, you are always welcome to join.
			</div>

			<h1>WHAT IS CREATIVE CODING?</h1>
			<div class = "text">
				You could say creative coding is a type of computer programming where rather than trying to create something functional, you create something expressive. It could be visuals, art, design, sound, robots, installations, or whatever. We don't really care, it doesn't have to be computer programming, it could be electronics or something else tech-y. It doesn't even necessarily have to be expressive, as long as it's something interesting.

			<a href="http://v2.nl">V2_Community</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.openhack.nl/">Open Hack, Service Design Meetups</a> & Creative Coding Rotterdam presents a series of all day themed hackathons with the name "Hacking_...". During this first edition the theme is PLAY and we mean it in the broadest sense. Whether you are an artist, a hacker, a philosopher, an architect, a gamer or a kindergarten teacher, you are invited to join and explore the theme PLAY with us during this day. We will divide into groups and put our brilliant minds together to think of new projects, programs & initiatives to make our community, city and digital platforms more playful. We will spend the day "hacking" and in the evening we hold a public presentation of the work that was produced during the day and celebrate our progress with a few drinks.<br><br>
			<h3>PROGRAMME:</h3>

			10:00 coffee and tea<br>

			10:15 introductions, short pitches of ideas/plans for the day <br>

			11:00 - 18:00 hacking (bring your own lunch, or buy it around the corner)<br>

			19:00 presentations <br><br>

			V2_ Institute for the Unstable Media<br>
			Eendrachtsstraat 10, Rotterdam<br><br>

			There will be some short informal talks/conversations by interesting people. That's you! Let us know if you have something to share.
